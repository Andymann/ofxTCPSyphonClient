# ofxTCPSyphonClient
Attempting to recreate the functionality of TCPSClient from https://techlife.sg but completely open source, based on openframeworks.
The server component can be found here: https://github.com/Andymann/ofxTcpSyphonServer

The name is actually misleading since the only thing in common is the structure of the header data that are added to the network payload. 
Those are derived from techlife's idea. See this repo for more information: https://github.com/Andymann/tcpSyphonServer_Java

This software is NOT compatible with the TCPSyphonServer /-Client from techlife.sg. For the original version have a look over here: https://github.com/z37soft
